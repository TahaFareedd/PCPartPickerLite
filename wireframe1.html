        1) The idea I have is that I will add a part of the website where you will be able to choose from a set amount of computer parts and see them put together
    </p>

    <p>
        2) The 2D part will be the choosing of the pc parts and the 3D part could be a model of the computer where it shows all the parts put together
    </p>

    <p>
        3) It is not longer a prebuilt computer app instead it is an app where you can choose pc parts
    </p>

    <p>
        4) It helps newcomers and veterns alike in choosing pc parts for a website all in one place
    </p>
    <p>
        5) I can use AR to show a computer in real time and create a forum page where users can interact with eachother
    </p>

    <p>
        6) 
        1. Because it can help people build a pc
        2. Because it can show people what the PC looks like in real time
        3. A forum page where people can show off their builds or ask for advice on certain things
    </p>

    <p>
        7) 
        1. in 3D the website could get too complicated for no reason
        2. in 3D the users can see a 3D image of the pc they're trying to buy
        3. in 3D you can add an AR feature which also shows people their PC in real time
    </p>

    <p>
        8) AR can help peole see PC in real time. VR is not necessary for this website.
